## BLOC Pattern
This Sample Shopping Cart app has been developped using BLOC(Business Logic Component) pattern for state management. I have choosen BLOC over the popular GetX state menagement because BLOC can be used as an state management library, moreover it acts as an Architectural pattern which add more organized stucture to the code. 

GetX is also an State managemnt library gaining high popularity in these days. GetX has simplified the coding but when refer the Git repositpry we can see still it has got many issues with compared to BLOC.
